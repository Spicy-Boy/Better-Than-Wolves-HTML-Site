                    Back in the day, the frontiersman of BTW only had word-of-mouth lore, grit, determination, and a little file called "how to beat BTW.txt" to guide them through the game. This page that you are reading right now, how-to-beat-BTW.html, is the evolution of that concept!

                    Without spoiling the game, this page serves as a basic recipe guide for the various crafting recipes you will need to beat Better Than Wolves. The recipes are presented in a somewhat chronological list, with the most important survival recipes up front and the more complex recipes closer to the bottom.

                    The advice offered here is not exhaustive--it serves ,mainly to highlight the most important information you need to get started. The guide concludes with crafting a windmill, pictured above. For a more robust guide with all the latest secrets, tips, and tricks, see the [REDACTED] page.

                    It is smart to gather 3 or 4 loose stones right away. Then, use the sharp stones on trees to gather at least 10 sticks.

                <p>

                </p>
                <p> 
                    Best times to fish:
                    <li>
                        Sunrise / Sunset: fish dine at twilight
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Raining: Fishing rate doubled-- fish come to the surface to feed during storms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Full moon: Fishing rate multiplied by 8x-- the fish go wild!

                <p>
                    You can't catch fish in caves or shallow ponds. A deep river, or the ocean, will yield fish. Build an elevated dock or enclosed hut to fish safely at night.

                    The gold nuggets required to craft latches makes them quite valuable.

                    The lever emits a redstone signal when triggered, and it emits nothing when turned off.

                <p>
                    Gearbox clutches are a kind of gearbox that can be turned off with redstone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a redstone current is applied to a clutch, the mechanism disengages and mechanical power no longer flows through it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a number of practical applications for this, but initially you will find it valuable for disengaging your windmill during storms. Windmills caught in heavy rain will destroy the gearbox attached to it unless it is disengaged.

                    A windmill can run as many millstones as your little heart desires, completely free. Puts our modern life into perspective, doesn't it?
