Back in the day, the frontiersman of BTW only had word-of-mouth advice, true grit, and a scrap of a text file called "how to beat BTW.txt." This page, how to beat BTW.html, is the evolution of that concept! 

Without spoiling the game, this page serves as a basic recipe guide for the various crafting recipes you will need to beat Better Than Wolves. The recipes are presented in a somewhat chronological list, with the most important survival recipes up front and the more complex recipes closer to the bottom.

The advice offered here is not exhaustive--it mainly serves to highlight the most important information you need to get started in Better Than Wolves. It concludes with crafting a windmill, pictured above. For a more robust guide with all the latest secrets, tips, and tricks, see the Advanced Survival Strategies page.
