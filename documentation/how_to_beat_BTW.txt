Hi

So you're finally forcing yourself to try the new BTW, eh? Good, it can be a lot of fun. Follow this barebones guide. 
It is purposefully sparse because figuring out survival techniques is part of the fun!

STEP 1: Create a world. Turn cheats off because Flowerchild will actually come and murder you if you don't.

STEP 2: Punch a log. You might be doing this for a while, so don't give up.

STEP 3: Acquire STICK. Place stick in crafting grid to produce POINTY STICK.

STEP 4: Use the pointy stick on some exposed stone. Acquire ROCK.

STEP 5: Place the rock in crafting grid to produce SHARP ROCK.

NOTE: SHARP ROCKS are your early game mining tool. Don't get confused, pointy sticks are not great for anything else.

STEP 6: Use the sharp rock to harvest more sharp rocks and more sticks from trees. Maybe kill an animal or two?

NOTE: DON'T ACCIDENTALLY USE UP ALL YOUR ROCKS ON STICK COLLECTION, ALWAYS KEEP ONE SO YOU CAN GET MORE!!

STEP 7: As the sun begins to set, dig down into the dirt and block yourself in.

Use 4 sticks to make a CAMPFIRE.
VV
Use 2 sticks to make a FIRE PLOW.

STEP 8: Hold right click on the campfire with the fire plow. This will take forever but stick with it. A little over half
durability, a fire should light. Right click with sharp stick to make a 'spit' and place some uncooked food on it.

NOTE: A bigger fire does not mean a quicker cook time. Keep it in the middle so you don't waste all your fuel!

STEP 9: In the morning, kill spiders or harvest spider string with a sharp rock. Acquire STRING.

STEP 10: Craft a SHOVEL with the string. Come on, you can figure out the recipe at this point.
Use the shovel to harvest 16 clay, leave the clay in a safe spot to dry (this takes a while!).

NOTE: If you are tight on string, maybe start by making an axe. Axes are nice. They can chop logs into sticks!

STEP 11: PROFIT!! Hopefully learning to succeed in the above 10 steps will give you the mindset you'll need 
to beat the game. Search for iron, coal, and other nice things and eventually reach CRAFTING TABLE!!!!!!!!

Good luck
