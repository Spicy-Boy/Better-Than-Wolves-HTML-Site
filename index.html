                    Back in the day, the frontiersman of BTW only had word-of-mouth lore, grit, determination, and a little file called "how to beat BTW.txt" to guide them through the game. This page that you are reading right now, how-to-beat-BTW.html, is the evolution of that concept!

                    Without spoiling the game, this page serves as a basic recipe guide for the various crafting recipes you will need to beat Better Than Wolves. The recipes are presented in a somewhat chronological list, with the most important survival recipes up front and the more complex recipes closer to the bottom.

                    The advice offered here is not exhaustive--it mainly serves to highlight the most important information you need to get started in Better Than Wolves. It concludes with crafting a windmill, pictured above. For a more robust guide with all the latest secrets, tips, and tricks, see the Advanced Survival Strategies page.
